Batch conversion of Apple´s silly .heic format to .jpg that we´re used to.
There is also some fiddling made to get correct date of photo "snapptime" since file date and snaptime often do not match due to "smart" synch tools from Apple...

It can be important and nice to list photos in date order, so a correct date is of the essence.

Depends on exiftool.exe and heictojpeg binarys.
