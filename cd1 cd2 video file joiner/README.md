This script runs through a media library and finds split video files.
The criteria is that the split parts contain cd1 and cd2 in their name.

Just set the variables to fit your setup.
Dendency is ffmpeg.exe which does the joining of files.

When itÂ´s done the original files are left for manual or scripted removal.
